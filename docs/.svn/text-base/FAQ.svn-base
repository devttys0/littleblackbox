1) My router/VPN/printer/server/etc isn't listed in the LittleBlackBox database. Does this mean I'm safe?

	Maybe. Maybe not. If it is not listed in the database then either it doesn't use default SSL keys
	or we haven't gotten around to adding them yet.

2) My router/VPN/printer/server/etc is listed in the LittleBlackBox database. What do I do?

	If you have the ability to change the default SSL certificates, do so immediately. If this is not
	possible, then treat your HTTPS sessions as if they were un-secure HTTP sessions. It may also be 
	possible to tunnel your connections through another service, such as SSH.

3) How did you get these SSL keys?

	By extracting them from the device's firmware. 

4) I have a piece of software/firmware/whatever that uses default SSL keys. How can I contribute them to the LittleBlackBox project?

	Yes!

	We will need you to send us a copy of the public certificate and the private key. Additionally, you will
	need to fill out the submission.txt template (located in the docs directory) with as much information as 
	possible - the more the better. ZIP up these three files and send them to: littleblackbox@devttys0.com.

5) I have hacked XYZ's server and have their SSL keys. How can I contribute them to the LittleBlackBox project?

	You don't. We will not accept illegally obtained SSL keys.

6) Once I have a private key, how do I decrypt and/or man-in-the-middle HTTPS sessions?
	
	LittleBlackBox is essentially a certificate manager and does not provide decryption capabilities. However, 
	there are existing tools that will do this provided you have the SSL private key:
	
		o Wireshark has the ability to decrypt SSL traffic (www.wireshark.org).
		o SSLsniff can man-in-the-middle SSL sessions (www.thoughtcrime.org).

7) I've found a bug in the LittleBlackBox utility and/or an invalid entry in the lbb.db database.

	Please report all bugs to the LittleBlackBox Google Code page: http://code.google.com/p/littleblackbox/issues/list.
